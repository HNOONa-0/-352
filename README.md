## How to use the program(s)

1. run test_func() in command window


2. type the desired method of calculation, one of the following: ```huen```,```euler_forward```,```euler_backward```,```midpoint```

3. type in all the other arguments (```exact function```,```number of points```,```step size```, etc...)

the result of the used method is then plotted along with associated **Absolute Errors** and **Relative Errors** for each $y_i$
